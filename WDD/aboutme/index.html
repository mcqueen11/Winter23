    <p>Hello my name is Logan and im currently living in Provo Utah. Im originally from Twin Falls
        Idaho and have lived there my whole life. I was looking into the nursing program for a while 
        but have recently had a change in interest and started taking up coding and programming. Some of 
        my hobbies include Snowboarding, Picklball, Spikeball, and longboarding. </p> 
    <p>Im not currently married but have a girlfriend. Im currently working at a 
        psychiatry clinic helping established patients with their accounts and screening 
        new pateitns to see if we would be a good fit for them. </p>
    <p>I have been interested with web develepment because ive always wanted to use this skill
        to help with web pages for my business. I also want to be able to be creative and see 
        ways I can help others with this skill.</p>
    <p>I was born in the covenant and served a mission in the Philippines Quezon City Mission.
        I absolutleyt love learning new languages because of my mission, so learning HTML is just
        another language I can add to the books.
