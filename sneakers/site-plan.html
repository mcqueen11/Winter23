      <h3>Jordan Era</h3>
      <p>
        One of the top-selling shoes that we focus on here at Drippy Drops is the infamous Air Jordan. Created and branded in 1984 during a deal 
            with Nike and the NBA, focusing on the soon to be basketball legend Michael Jordan, this shoe is both historic and iconic as well as 
            futuristic in its upcoming designs and drops. We love the classics here at Drippy Drops and the Jordans are about as classic as they come. 
            Anyone in the ball game knows that every team has a most valuable player and when it comes to the shoes game, Air Jordans are the real MVP.
            Here you can expect to see every upcoming and new Jordan release on this page that is exclusively dedicated to Air Jordans in all their glory.
            One of the most recent and popular drops from Nike is the "Air Jordan 1 Retro 'Lost and Found'." You can expect these to cost around $300 to 
            $400 given their popularity. An upcoming style to be aware of are the "Air Jordan 1 High OG 'Washed Black'." These are expecting to drop on 
            June 10th of 2023. Everyone is looking to get their hands on this pair given its versatility to styling any fit.

      <h3>Dunks on the Rise</h3>
      <p>
        One shoe that has more recently boomed in popularity are the Nike Dunks. Dunks were initially introduced back in 1985 as a performance 
            basketball shoe. They are now worn and praised by the entire Nike community as a casual everyday type sneaker. Nike Dunks are constantly
            being released on a daily to weekly basis, making it difficult to stay on top of the ball and secure the shoes of your dreams. There will
            be categories specifically for each type of sneaker that will pull up images and release dates making sure you are always in the loop.
            For starters the most fashionable and popular Nike dunk that has everyone searching to get a pair is the "Nike 'Panda' Dunk." This shoe
            has been restocked in stores on a monthly basis due to its popularity. We want to make sure that when sneakers like these are getting all
            the hype, that you are able to be get notified to and ready to snag a pair.
